## Personal portfolio site for Jessica Keoshian

The live production version of the site can be viewed at [https://jessicakeoshian.com](https://jessicakeoshian.com)

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

It uses [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to provide a helpful CMS admin interface for editing the site's contents.

## Development

Run `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The site will auto-update as you edit files.

## Deploying

Netlify automatically kicks off a new production deploy each time changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

Opening a pull request for a branch will trigger a preview build in Netlify, allowing you to preview your changes in a production-like environment before merging.
