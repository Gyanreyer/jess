          If dads are being included in the parenting space, where can they
          change their babies when out in public? Public restrooms still lack
          inclusivity when it comes to having accessible changing tables in
          men’s rooms.

          We redesigned the dreaded old school changing table and brought it
          into the tech-first century. The smart table integrates with the
          revamped Pampers’ app to allow easy shopping for those ‘oops’ moments,
          moms and dads know too well.
