          If dads are being included in the parenting space, where can they change
          their babies when out in public? Public restrooms still lack
          inclusivity when it comes to having accessible changing tables in
          men’s rooms.

          We redesigned the dreaded old school changing table and brought it into
          the tech-first century. The smart table integrates with the revamped
          Pampers’ app to allow easy shopping for those ‘oops’ moments, moms and
          dads know too well.
