      Let Dads Change is a campaign focused on today’s shifting gender roles.
      Roles shift as more parents are splitting duties 50/50, and brands need to
      adapt. If dads are more active than ever, why is it so difficult to find a
      changing table in men’s rooms? Pampers changes that, and reinvents the
      changing table to fit this century of parents.
