        text: Public speaking is a passion of mine. For my senior thesis, I prepared
          multiple conversations around campus surrounding the topics of stress,
          empathy, and even time management. I was able to open the space for
          students to come and relax during finals and midterms, but also gave
          our own student center a new way to teach students about these topics
          in an approachable format.

        text: Listen to my final thesis speech here. In this speech, I discuss not only
          the importance of my journey with public speaking, but how we doubt
          ourselves in the creative world and how that translates into
          perspective.

        text: Since my thesis, I have continued in Toastmasters and have been invited
          back to my college to give talks on time management and preparedness.
          My topics revolve around how important presentation skills are for
          students and professionals, and how we can always keep improving once
          we get over the fear of public speaking.
