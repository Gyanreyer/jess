          Ferris mowers are known for their suspension. You can rely on a mower that
          gives you support and comfort with the smoothest ride- all with the
          enhanced large forefront suspension springs. This direct mail piece
          featured the suspension springs in the design, and read “Experience
          Suspension” along the bottom of the tube.

          Wright mowers are the original stand-on mower. With the standard of
          innovation, Wright mowers are safer and more efficient than riding
          mowers, allowing users to jump on and off. These mowers also take up
          less space on work trucks, and can fit in tighter, harder to cut
          sloped areas zero turns are not built for.
