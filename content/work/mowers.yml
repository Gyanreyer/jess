          Ferris mowers are known for their suspension. You can rely on a mower
          that gives you support and comfort with the smoothest ride- all with
          the enhanced large forefront suspension springs. This direct mail
          piece featured the suspension springs in the design, and read
          “Experience Suspension” along the bottom of the tube.

          Wright mowers are the original stand-on mower. With the standard of
          innovation, Wright mowers are safer and more efficient than riding
          mowers, allowing users to jump on and off. These mowers also take up
          less space on work trucks, and can fit in tighter, harder to cut
          sloped areas zero turns are not built for.
